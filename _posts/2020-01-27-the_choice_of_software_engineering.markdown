In many cases, it takes people a while to figure out what career they want to pursue; my route so far has been an unconventional one, but I am feeling confident that software engineering is the right next step for me. I currently have been in the workforce for four years, and have come to a point in my career where I am looking for something that aligns more with the skills that I enjoy and that I can find more importance in. 
In my current career as a healthcare systems analyst, I work as an interface between clinicians and the medical record software that is used to document information, track patient care, store and report on data, and much more. Reflecting upon my career, I realized that I most enjoy my time at work when I am tasked with figuring out how to translate a real world clinical scenario into the software. This often involves creating and designing a new workflow in the system through a process of planning, trial, and error. I find it very rewarding to build something new in the program and then see it come to life in a meaningful way. Although my current career can be fulfilling in some ways, my technical role and knowledge is limited to the specific software I was trained in, and I desire to have the reach to do much more. My natural inclination for problem solving and getting my hands into the system lead me to become interested in software engineering as a career and expand upon the parts of my job that I enjoy. 
I began my path to switch into software engineering by taking a computer science preparatory course through University of Massachusetts online over this last year. This program consisted of four classes including Programming with C, Programming with Java, Data Structures and Fundamental Algorithms, and Computer systems. These courses introduced me to the world of computers and coding. Although they are just an introduction, I was able to excel in these courses and gain affirmation that I enjoy this type of work and confidence that I would be able to take on the challenges of a career switch into this field.
Most of all, I chose software engineering for the flexibility that I see in it. When thinking about my future, I aspire to have a career where I feel challenged, get to utilize my strengths, and can have a positive impact - I feel that  software enginering offers all of that. When you have versetile skills, you then also have the power to choose what kind of company you want to work for - you can choose a place that aligns with your passions, beliefs, goals, and interests. Although my journey has just begun, I am very hopeful for the possibilities
